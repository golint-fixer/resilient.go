# resilient.go

Extensible and middleware-oriented HTTP client with superpowers like fail over, balanced and dynamic server discovery,
designed for distributed and reactive systems

**This is a work in progress**

## Installation

```
go get gopkg.in/resilient-http/resilient.go.v0
```

## Rationale

Distributed and reactive system architectures are growing during last years, but they are mostly hard to support since most of the complexibility is delegated in the consumer side.

Resilient aims to simplify this to deal elegantly with distributed systems
